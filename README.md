## üß† About Me

Hello, my name is **Tom√°≈° Musil**. I am a 17-year-old high school student with a strong passion for technology, software development, and digital creativity. My primary focus lies in **backend development**, but I am equally comfortable working on the frontend when needed. I am currently expanding my skills in **mobile, software, and web development** to become a more versatile and proficient developer.

My journey in IT began at a very young age‚ÄîI built my first computer when I was just eight years old. Since then, technology has become a core part of my identity, and I continuously strive to evolve with it. I aspire to pursue an **engineering degree** to deepen my knowledge and pursue advanced technical challenges in the future.

## üìå Pinned Projects

### [TomFi](https://github.com/TomasMusi/TomFi)

**TomFi** is a full-stack banking application designed as a personal learning project to explore secure transaction systems, user authentication, and modern web development techniques.

**Tech Stack:** SvelteKit, TypeScript, MariaDB, TailwindCSS, AES/RSA encryption, SQL transactions

Key Features:
- Virtual credit card creation & management
- Symmetric & asymmetric encryption (AES + RSA) 
- PIN-secured operations with backend validatio 
- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) 
- Full transaction system with charts & analytics  
- QR code-based payment system




> This project significantly contributed to my growth as a developer by deepening my understanding of secure backend systems, encryption, data validation, and clean architecture in a full-stack environment.

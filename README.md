## About Me

Hello, my name is **Tomáš Musil**. I am a 17-year-old high school student with a strong passion for technology, software development, and digital creativity. My primary focus lies in **backend development**, but I am equally comfortable working on the frontend when needed. I am currently expanding my skills in **mobile, software, and web development** to become a more versatile and proficient developer.

My journey in IT began at a very young age—I built my first computer when I was just eight years old. Since then, technology has become a core part of my identity, and I continuously strive to evolve with it. I aspire to pursue an **engineering degree** to deepen my knowledge and pursue advanced technical challenges in the future.
